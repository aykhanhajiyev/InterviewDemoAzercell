# Azercell Demo Interview App

### Introduction
- Welcome, everyone! Today, I'll be presenting the iOS application I developed as part of our programming homework.
- The purpose of this application is to showcase my problem-solving skills and coding style.
- Throughout the presentation, I will walk you through the functionalities and features of the application.

### Application Overview 

The iOS application I developed is designed to meet the following requirements:
- Creation of a customer profile with fields such as Name, Surname, Birth Date, and GSM Number.
- Creation of a 16-digit Debit Card with an initial balance of 10 AZN.
- Ability to transfer balance between customer cards.
- Removal of a Debit Card from the system.

### Creating a Customer
Let's start with the customer creation process.
- In the application, users can enter their Name, Surname, Birth Date, and GSM - Number to create a customer profile.
- The information provided is then stored within the application.

### Creating a Debit Card
- After creating a customer, users can generate a Debit Card.
- The Debit Card has a unique 16-digit number, and a default balance of 10 AZN is assigned to it.
- This card is associated with the customer's profile.

### Transferring Balance
- One of the key features of the application is the ability to transfer balance between customer cards.
- Users can select the sender and recipient cards, enter the desired amount, and initiate the transfer.
- The balance is updated accordingly for both cards involved in the transfer.

### Removing a Debit Card
In certain scenarios, a Debit Card might need to be removed from the system.
- Users have the option to remove a Debit Card from the customer's profile.
- Once removed, the card and its associated balance are no longer accessible.

### Code Highlights
Now, let's take a closer look at some key aspects of the code implementation.
- You can check below files where you can find logic there.
```bash
  - CustomerHelper.swift
  - DebitCardHelper.swift
```
- These elements showcase my problem-solving skills and coding style.

### Conclusion and Future Improvements
To summarize, I have presented the functionalities and features of the iOS application I developed.
- The application successfully meets the requirements outlined in the homework.
- In the future, there is potential for further improvements and additional features to enhance the application's capabilities.

### Questions and Answers
- Thank you for your attention! I am now open to any questions you may have.
- Please feel free to ask about any aspect of the application or my coding implementation.
